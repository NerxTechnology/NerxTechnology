<h2>Mignon</h2>

<h2>Game Jams</h2>
<p>Small, free games made for game jams over the course of a weekend to a month. All hosted on itch at <a href="https://nerxtech.itch.io/">https://nerxtech.itch.io</a>. The programming was done by me for all of these, as well as some of the art.</p>

  <h3>Planets in 20</h3>
  <p>Created for the 20s Game jam. There can only be 20 seconds of gameplay in the game, no carry over from previous plays (ex. no upgrades), and easy restart. I had planned to contribute to the Proc Gen Jam that happened before this one so I was learning about procedural generation, especially for world generation. I ended up putting that knowledge into the 20s jam. <a href="https://nerxtech.itch.io/planets-in-20">Mobile and Desktop.</a></p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>Still here? There are unfinished or too small to be called a game. Mostly prototypes to try something out. Some of them link to playable web build. Many feature open source art.</p>

  <h3><a href="IsometricCrows/index.html">Crows Crows Crows</a></h3>
  <p>Trying out an isolmetric grid layout. Move around with the arrow keys or tap, run over a worm to eat it.</p>

  <h3>Frog Sci-fi Zine Explorer</h3>
  <p>I never really figured how to do turn based action in a way that I was happy with, which makes anything in the genre too big to do much with and therefore relegated to Experiements. This one was inspiried by the massive cottage industry of TTRPGs, especially solo and journaling ones. You roll to make the map as you go. The creatures and places are stock photos or photos I took (and a still from video of an otter eating) that are modified to have a 'zine' look - grainy, fewer colours, etc. I guess it's supposed to be a sci-fi version of low budget travel journalling. Images of places are square and over saturated for a kind of holographic-polaroid look, and the map tiles are in a purely holographic style. The protagonist was going to be a frog and other small creatures, and travel is easiest in more watery terrains. It's largely meant to feel like the Pacific Northwest in winter. The sound effects are all recorded by me or family and are undeniably <i>wet.</i></p>

  <h3><a href="https://nerxtech.itch.io/bee-planter">Bees</a></h3>
  <p>City builders and RTSs are typically based on resource extraction, but functioning ecosystems self regulate with feedback loops. Flowers lead to bees lead to flowers.</p>

  <h3>BirdRPG</h3>
  <p>I love this little prototype but never managed to a make a playable build. The beautiful art is from <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/two-pheasants:fsg_F1929.78">public domain</a> sources. I even read the first half of a modern translation of Canterbury Tales - I thought it seemed very <i>*~* fanatasy *~*</i> with a bunch of quirky characters going on medieval adventures (it's mostly about fucking and how much you love God and astrology and is a bit dark by modern standards).<br>In BirdRPG you play as pet pheasant named Amelia who has escaped into the forest and wants to become a knight after meeting a wild pheasant knight.</p>
