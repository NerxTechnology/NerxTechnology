<h2>Game Jams</h2>
<p>Small, free games made for game jams over the course of a weekend to a month. All hosted on itch at <a href="https://nerxtech.itch.io/">https://nerxtech.itch.io</a>. The programming was done by me for all of these, as well as some of the art.</p>

  <h3>Planets in 20</h3>
  <p>Created for the 20s Game jam. There can only be 20 seconds of gameplay in the game, no carry over from previous plays (ex. no upgrades), and easy restart. I had planned to contribute to the Proc Gen Jam that happened before this one so I was learning about procedural generation, especially for world generation. I ended up putting that knowledge into the 20s jam. Mobile or Desktop.</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>Still here? There are unfinished or too small to be called a game. Mostly prototypes to try something out. Some of them link to playable web build, some of them are screenshots. Many of them feature open source art.</p>
