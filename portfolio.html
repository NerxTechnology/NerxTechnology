    <h3><a href="https://nerxtech.itch.io/">Game Jams</a></h3>
    <img class="preview" src="game-jams.png" />
    <p>Four game jams from the last year. I'm very happy with all of them and you should give them a little play on itch.io. They're done on teams of 2-3 people, where I mostly do the programming and sometimes a bit of art.<br />
    <br /><b>Champagne</b> A strategy game about making wine at a monastery, for the Global Game Jam (very fun in-person event).
    <br /><b>Planets In 20</b> A simulation game about starting a colony on a new planet. Made for the 20 Second jam, where gameplay is limited to 20 seconds.
    <br /><b>The Haunted Unboxing</b> Made for the Game Boy Jam, which uses a lot of the constraints a gameboy had. A nice halloween themed retroidvania you can finish in about 10 min. 
    <br /><b>Dinghy Sports</b> Made for an olympics themed jam, OlyGames, this one is a pretty straight forward set of 3 'sports'. I was doing a lot of paddling in the summer and wanted to capture the feeling of being washed around while navigating water.</p>

    <h3>Frog Sci-fi Zine Explorer</h3>
    <img class="preview" src ="previews/frog-zine.png" />
    <p>This one is inspiried by the cottage industry of TTRPGs, especially solo and journaling. You roll to make the map as you go. The creatures and places are stock photos or photos I took (and a still from video of an otter eating) that are modified to have a 'zine' look - grainy, fewer colours, etc. I guess it's supposed to be a sci-fi version of low budget travel journalling. Images of places are square and over saturated for a kind of holographic-polaroid look, and the map tiles are in a purely holographic style. The protagonists are frogs or other small creatures, and travel is easiest in more watery terrains. It's meant to feel like the Pacific Northwest in winter.</p>

    <img class="preview" src="screenshots/hex_map.png" />
    <img class="preview" src="screenshots/rules.jpg" />
    <p style="clear:both;">A paper game made for the Hex Crawl jam. I was watching too much Alone and now you too can experience bears and starvation in a table friendly format! Includes map and points of interest/rules.

    <h3>BirdRPG</h3>
    <img class="preview" src ="previews/flatbird.jpg" />
    <p>An RPG using public domain images. Imagine fighting with <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/two-pheasants:fsg_F1929.78">these two</a> on your side. You play as Amelia, a pet pheasant who escapes her enclosure to the forest, and hopes to become a knight.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://nerxtech.itch.io/bee-planter">Bees</a></h3>
    <img class="preview" src ="previews/bees.png" />
    <p>Very early experiement in drag and drop 'painbox' functionality. City builders and RTSs are typically based on resource extraction, but functioning ecosystems self regulate with feedback loops. Flowers lead to bees lead to flowers.</p>
